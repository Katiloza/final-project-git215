                    Nestled in a beautiful valley in the Swiss Alps, our resort is the perfect escape 
                    from the mundane. Dining options include an Italian restaurant, and ski-in bars on 
                    mountainside terraces. Other amenities consist of an upscale spa, hot tubs, a gym 
                    and a climbing wall. Breakfast is available.

                <p>

                    verdant mountains and valleys, we have it all. You can hit the slopes and build a snowman 
                    in the winter, and you can head out for a hike, picnics, and swimming in the spring and 
                    summer. Escape the ordinary with us!
